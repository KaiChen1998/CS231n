# Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition(CS231n) @ Stanford
## This is my CS231n homework. It's actually a good exercise!
### See details in [CS231n Official Site](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)
- Assignment 1: Mostly linear classifier, including knn, svm, softmax, two layer neural network and image feature, which gain a 50% - 55% accuracy on CIFAR10

- Assignment 2: Advanced neural network tricks including FC layer of any depth, dropout, Batch Normalization, CNN, Pytorch/Tensorflow <br>Using self-designed CNN architecture and get an accuracy of 73% on cifar-10 temporarily
<br>(Tips: If you'd like to get more familiar with bachpropagation, I highly recommadation you to try BN backprop. It's exciting!) 

- Assignment 3: More focus on real computer vision application of Neural Network including:
1. Image Captioning using vanilla and LSTM (pre-processed Microsoft COCO)
2. CNN Network Visualization (Imagenet)
3. GANs
4. Style Transfer (Squeezenet) :joy: Interesting but easy vision model
