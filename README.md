# Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition(CS231n) @ Stanford
## This is my CS231n homework. It's actually a good exercise!
- Assignment 1: Mostly linear classifier, including knn, svm, softmax, two layer neural network and image feature, which gain a 50% - 55% accuracy on CIFAR10

- Assignment 2: Advanced neural network tricks including FC layer of any depth, dropout, Batch Normalization, CNN, Pytorch/Tensorflow 
<br>(Tips: If you'd like to get more familiar with bachpropagation, I highly recommadation you to try BN backprop. It's exciting!) 

- Assignment 3: I haven't finished yet :laughing:
