# Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition(CS231n) @ Stanford
## This is my CS231n homework. It's actually a good exercise!
### See details in [CS231n Official Site](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)
1. Assignment 1: Mostly linear classifier, including knn, svm, softmax, two layer neural network and image feature, which gain a 50% - 55% accuracy on CIFAR10

2. Assignment 2: Advanced neural network tricks including FC layer of any depth, dropout, Batch Normalization, CNN, Pytorch/Tensorflow
- Using self-designed CNN architecture and get an accuracy of 73% on cifar-10 temporarily
- (Tips: If you'd like to get more familiar with bachpropagation, I highly recommadation you to try BN backprop. It's exciting!:smile:) 

3. Assignment 3: More focus on real computer vision application of Neural Network including:
- Image Captioning using vanilla and LSTM (pre-processed Microsoft COCO)
- CNN Network Visualization (Imagenet)
- GANs
- Style Transfer (Squeezenet) :joy: Interesting but easy vision model 

There is not a too good word to describe this assignment. From basic deep learning knowledge to fundamental Vision models (classfication -> detection -> semantic meaning). It's a very good **propaedeutic** module which not only for your Vision knowledge but also for you python and tensorflow understanding.

Thanks for all teaching staffs!
